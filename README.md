# Executive-Dashboard-with-Tableau

INTRODUCTION

The data analystâ€™s job does not end once the data has been analyzed. A vital skill for data analysts is to represent and report the data to stakeholders. In this task, you will demonstrate your ability to identify actionable insights from data and communicate them using effective storytelling methods.

This task consists of three parts:

In part 1, you will use SQL and a business intelligence tool to create data dashboards to support executive decision-making. Your dashboards should enable leaders to answer a specific research question on an organizational need. It is recommended, but not required, that the business intelligence tool be Tableau.

Your dashboard will integrate data from two sources:

1. Provided data set: You will select one of the data sets and associated data dictionaries from the web link "D211 Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries" located on Labs on Demand.

Note: It is recommended, but not required, that you choose the same data set that you used for your performance assessments in previous courses. Review the data dictionary that is relevant to your chosen data set for additional details about the audience.

2. Additional data set: You will identify an external, public data set as an additional data set for your dashboard. This data set should contain data and variables that complement the data set you chose from the provided options and should enhance the insights you can gain from the provided data set. Recommended sources include U.S. census data, Kaggle, or other public data repositories. You are responsible for ensuring that you have the rights to use the data set.

In part 2, you will give a simulated presentation to a panel of peers. You will describe the use of SQL in preparing the data from the two data sets for the analysis and then demonstrate the functionality of the SQL scripts and other codes that supported the creation of the dashboards.

In part 3, you will write a reflection paper to outline the organizational need and summarize the findings from the analysis.
Refer to the data dictionary for your chosen provided data set for additional background information about the audience of your data representations.

Part 1: Data Dashboards

A. Provide a copy of your dashboards that support executive decision-making.

1. Provide both data sets that serve as the data source for the dashboards.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions to guide users through the dashboard installation.
3. Provide clear instructions to help users navigate the dashboards.
4. Provide a copy of all SQL code and other code supporting the dashboards.


Part 3: Report

C. Write a report to outline the data exploration, use of advanced SQL operations, and the analysis of the data. Do the following as part of your report:

1. Explain how the purpose and function of your dashboard aligns with the needs outlined in the data
dictionary associated with your chosen data set.
2. Justify the selection of the business intelligence tool you used.
3. Explain the steps used to clean and prepare the data for the analysis.
4. Summarize the steps used to create the dashboards.
